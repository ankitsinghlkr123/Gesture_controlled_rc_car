# Gesture-Controlled RC Car

This project showcases a hand gesture-controlled RC car using Arduino, MPU6050, and RF communication modules. The car responds to the tilt and orientation of the user's hand to move in different directions, providing a hands-free control experience.

## üöó Project Overview

- **Input Device**: MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)
- **Wireless Transmission**: 434 MHz RF Transmitter & Receiver
- **Microcontrollers**: 2x Arduino UNO
- **Actuators**: 2x BO DC Motors driven by L293D Motor Driver
- **Power**: 9V Battery (prototype) and 12V 4-cell battery (planned)

## üì° Communication Protocol

- Data from MPU6050 is processed on the transmitter Arduino.
- Specific gyroscopic values are converted into control signals.
- These signals are transmitted via RF module.
- Receiver Arduino interprets signals and drives motors accordingly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Circuit & Electronics (Simulation)

Due to TinkerCAD limitations (missing MPU6050 and RF modules), simulation uses:
- Flex sensors to mimic gesture input.
- Serial communication (TX/RX) between two Arduinos instead of RF.
- 9V battery instead of unavailable 12V supply.

**Note:** Real-world setup includes MPU6050 and RF communication, not represented in TinkerCAD.

## üß© 3D Design & Assembly

- A custom 3D model of the RC car was designed for laser cutting.
- The chassis was cut using acrylic sheets with slots for motors, Arduino, and sensors.

## üß† Learning Outcomes

- MPU6050 interfacing and signal processing
- RF communication implementation
- Motor driver integration with Arduino
- 3D design for laser fabrication
- Full hardware-software integration
